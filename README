Big thanks to Ben Tilly for providing a coding base to start from and a most informative

This repository calculates confidences for multiple split groups against the current winner

Input might look like this:

    sample_predetermined_gtest = {
      :winning_split_group => [1000, 150], 
      :loosing_split_group => [1000, 100], 
      :middle_split_group  => [1000, 125]}

The GTest class is called like this:

    predetermined_gtest = GTest.new sample_predetermined_gtest

The Yates correction is on by default, but can be toggled like this:

    predetermined_gtest.yates = :on

Split results are returned as a hash of arrays
Bellow is just one way to use them:
    
    split_results = predetermined_gtest.compare_split_groups
    array_of_g_stats = [(split_results[:loosing_split_group][0]*10_000).round.to_f / 10_000, 
                        (split_results[:middle_split_group][0]*10_000).round.to_f / 10_000]
    array_of_g_stats.should == [11.0386, 2.4311]

    array_of_confidences = [(split_results[:loosing_split_group][1]*10_000).round.to_f / 10_000, 
                            (split_results[:middle_split_group][1]*10_000).round.to_f / 10_000]
    array_of_confidences.should == [0.9991, 0.8811]
